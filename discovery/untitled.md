# Findings and Insights from Government

On the government end information gathered through accreditation is used by people working across different teams and roles in their work with providers. 

While we interviewed a lot of people across government they can be broadly categorised as belonging to:

* **Procurement**: Finds the right provider to fulfil a service.
* **Contract Management: **Ensures contracts are being correctly fulfilled.
* **Accreditation**: A third party review to ensure providers are safely delivering services to clients.
* **Government Staff: **General staff interacting with the social sector.

The unique ways they use information means that they have a range of priorities when it comes to what they need from Accreditron:

### **Procurement Team Member**

**It’s important to have the bigger picture  
**"Because I’m making decisions around which social services to spend on I need better intelligence about the provider landscape so I can make better informed contracting decisions and reduce duplication of effort."

### **Contracts Team Member**

**Information should be easy to access  
**"Getting information on providers can be difficult and time consuming. I need a way to easily get information about providers so that I can save time, make informed decisions, and mitigate risk."

### **Social Services Accreditation Team Member**

**Any new system needs to make things easier  
**"It’s important to me that new technology doesn’t make my job harder. I need a user friendly system so that I can perform tasks effectively and efficiently."

**Sharing information saves time and effort  
**"A lot of the information different agencies and even people within the same organisation gather from providers is similar. I need a way to easily share information so that I can save time and reduce duplication of effort."

### Government Staff Member

**Transparency around reporting is crucial  
**"Working across agencies having access to information on how reports were produced is important. I need transparency, I need to know:

* Who made an assessment
* Their background
* Information used to inform the report

So that I can trust their assessment."

**Better information means better work  
**"When I interact with a provider I need to know all the information about a provider and who they have interacted with so that I can show up informed, do a good job, and appear professional."
