# Findings and Insights from Providers

Every Social Service Provider goes through accreditation on a regular basis. Accreditation is an important part of making sure Providers meet all the requirements they need to, however, it can be a difficult process. Providers highlighted a number of pain-points where Accreditron could make their work easier:

### **The cost of compliance is too high**

**"**I need the cost of compliance to be lower; which may include: staff time, volunteer time, resources, and financial cost. Because my resources are scarce, I need to spend my time delivering service to clients."

### **Giving the right information to Government can be difficult**

"It can be hard to know which information the government needs from me. I need to clearly know what information is required and have an easy way to give it to them. I need be made aware of any problems quickly, so I can be certain that I have done everything I can to maintain a high standard of compliance."** **

### **Changes in processes and requirements are surprising**

"Government processes can change without me realising. I need to know when standards are changing and how, so I can stay compliant without the goal posts moving unexpectedly."

### **Government should help providers improve capability**

"Offering a social service is easier with the government’s help. I need and want assistance from agencies to develop and improve my organisation so I can provide the best service possible to the public."

### **Legal jargon is not easy to understand**

"While it’s my job to look after government contracts I don’t necessarily have a background in law. I need the standards to be easy to understand so I don’t have to waste money paying a lawyer to tell me what I need to do to be compliant."

### **A lack of consistency across government is risky to providers**

"As a Provider, I need consistency of behaviour and standards between different government staff — so if my contact changes I will know that I will still be found compliant.** "**
