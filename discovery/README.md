# Discovery

![](../.gitbook/assets/artboard-21.png)

Our first research was focused on the problem space of **social sector and government interactions**. At the time of this research, Acceditron did not exist. This discovery research and corresponding insights lead to the validation and development of Accreditron.

## Process

Over 70 **semi-structured interviews** with Social Service Providers and Government staff were conducted over a six-week period. This started in late February of 2017.

Interviews were focused on gathering qualitative information and less focused on gathering quantitative information. **Thematic analysis** was conducted to discover common insights.
