# Co-Design

## Benefits

Reduce risk and increase the chances of success by understanding problems from the perspectives of citizens, and run prototypes that inexpensively test solutions at a small scale.  
  
We run trials to help test our solution at a small scale:

Align diverse stakeholders by using methods that bring ‘the system’ into the room, and to support more effective conversations among diverse stakeholders. These diverse perspectives help produce solutions with greater integrity and resilience.

## Workshops with Government

To date, we have conducted 13 co-design government workshops and demonstrations to facilitate the feedback.  
  
We have worked with over 40 different business units across 15+ central agencies and crown agents and councils
