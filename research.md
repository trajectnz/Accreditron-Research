# About

## Overview {#0df8}

The New Zealand Government invests over $34 Billion a year into the social sector. A large portion of that funding goes to government services and agencies, whilst the rest goes to Social Service Providers \(NGO’s and Charities\) to deliver services on behalf of government, to New Zealanders in need.

Running a Social Service requires a lot of time, energy, and money to be put towards **government interactions **and** compliance** — which could be going to their clients. In February 2017 Accreditron began broadly researching this problem with the help of MSD, searching for pain-points and opportunities.

## Stages to Research

1. [Provider Discovery](discovery.md)
2. [Government Co-design](co-design.md)
3. [Trials](trials/untitled-1/)

### What is usability Research?

Because Accreditron is a multi-stakeholder platform. We are constantly running research and discovering how individuals will interact. Accreditron is a solution for many complicated processes and services.

### Who are the users?

#### Social Service Providers

NGO's and Charities that deliver social services. 

#### Government Employees

Social Sector Accreditation Team, Government Contract Management Teams, Procurement Teams, Researchers, Leadership, etc



Accreditron is a platform that makes it easier for Social Service Providers to spend less time on paperwork so they can spend more time with their clients. Every insight above has been thought about carefully during the initial design and build of the Platform.
