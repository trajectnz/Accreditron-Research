# About

Accreditron is a platform that makes it easier for Social Service Providers to spend less time on paperwork so they can spend more time with their clients.

## Overview {#0df8}

The New Zealand Government invests over $34 Billion a year into the social sector. A large portion of that funding goes to government services and agencies, whilst the rest goes to Social Service Providers \(NGO’s and Charities\) to deliver services on behalf of government, to New Zealanders in need.

Running a Social Service requires a lot of time, energy, and money to be put towards **government interactions **and** compliance** — which could be going to their clients. In February 2017 Accreditron began broadly researching this problem with the help of MSD, searching for pain-points and opportunities.

## About the Team {#bde6}

We’re a company of designers, copy-writers, user-researchers, talkers, and software engineers. We prioritise design, full-stop. Moreover, we think that pleasant and purposeful user experience is a key offering to the stakeholders and users of Accreditron. A _stakeholder_ being someone who has interest in the product versus a _user _being a person who will actively engage in using the product. Our stakeholders are spread across different levels of New Zealand Government and the Social Sector. Every person comes from a different background, they think differently from each other, and they all use computers in different ways.

We think Accreditron should be zero cost to the social sector. This means, like many enterprise software companies, the people funding Accreditron are not representative of all the users that will engage with the product. Instead, funding stakeholders might be the management, government leadership, or funding organisations. **Because of this difference in incentives, a disconnect can form between what the funding stakeholder wants and what the users need.**

Usability research is an essential contributor to our success and why we take design and evidence-based decision making seriously. It also allows us to keep the voice of all users at the table and supports us to build our product directly for the people using it. _It’s all about collaboration and communication._

## Usability Research {#42f9}

Usability research is the process of researching and interviewing people who interact with Accreditron. From gathering broad data on their problems or journey — to detailed research like watching a person perform a task to understand their thought process.

For every component on Accreditron, we first research why we should build it and test our assumptions. Then after we design or build something worth testing, we research and measure how our solution performed against our original assumptions. With those results, we can make changes to improve the experience and repeat the process. This is sometimes referred to as the build-measure-learn cycle.

Usability research is one option for gathering data and measuring performance. By holding many usability sessions and interviews, we can pull all of the information together to develop insights across a sample group. Then use these gathered insights to drive the design of Accreditron and provide validation where possible.
