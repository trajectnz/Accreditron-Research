# Discovery

## Background

This research was conducted to understand the problem space of social sector and government interactions. At the time of this research, Acceditron did not exist. This discovery research and corresponding insights lead to the validation and development of Accreditron.

## Process

Over 70 s**emi-structured interviews** with Social Service Providers and Government staff were conducted over a six-week period. This started in late February of 2017.

Interviews were focused on gathering qualitative information and less focused on gathering quantitative information. **Thematic analysis** was conducted to discover common insights. 

## Findings and Insights for Providers

Here are the top six insights collected from Social Service Providers during this discovery process:

### 1. **The cost of compliance is too high**

> As a Provider, I need the cost of compliance to be lower; which may include: staff time, volunteer time, resources, and financial cost. Because my resources are scarce, I need to spend my time delivering service to clients.

### 2. Giving the right information to Government can be difficult

> As a Provider, I need to clearly know what information government requires, and have an easy way to give it to them. I need be made aware of any problems quickly, so I can be certain that I have done everything I can to maintain a high standard of compliance.

### 3. **Changes in processes and requirements are surprising**

> As a Provider, I need to know when Government standards are changing and how, so I can stay compliant without the goal posts moving unexpectedly.

### 4. **Government should help providers improve capability**

> As a Provider, I need and want assistance from agencies to develop and improve my organisation so I can provide the best service possible to the public.

### 5. Legal jargon is not easy to understand

> As a Provider, I need the standards to be easy to understand, so I don’t have to waste money paying a lawyer to tell me what I need to do to be compliant.

### 6. **A lack of consistency across government is risky to providers**

> As a Provider, I need consistency of behaviour and standards between different government staff — so if my contact changes, I will know that I will still be found compliant.



## Finding and Insights for Government

Here are the top six insights collected from Government during this discovery process:

### 1. Sharing information is too time consuming.

### 2. More trust and transparency is needed in the sector.
