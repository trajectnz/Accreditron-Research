# Trials

## Benefits of conducting a trial of Accreditron:

1. higher quality and more usable software,
2. optimising system performance and ensuring efficiency gains,
3. highlighting pain-points and identifying growth opportunities,
4. measure performance to baseline metric, 
5. validate and drive decision making,
6. reduced development costs, and
7. reduced support cost.

By getting real people using the software during a trial, we can collect real-world measurements. Better software means a better experience, and this means better relationships - **happier providers and happier staff**.

## What we changed about our platform when we listened to our users {#99c9}

[Accreditron](http://www.accreditron.com/) is a “multi-stakeholder” software product. When designing Accreditron our team has to think about every little interaction or edge-case. _How does someone sign-in? What should be the first thing they see? What happens if we put this button in the bottom-right versus top-left? What if someone tries to click the page 500 times a second?_
