# Trials

## Benefits of conducting a trial of Accreditron:

1. higher quality and more usable software,
2. optimising system performance and ensuring efficiency gains,
3. highlighting pain-points and identifying growth opportunities,
4. measure performance to baseline metric, 
5. validate and drive decision making,
6. reduced development costs, and
7. reduced support cost.

By getting real people using the software during a trial, we can collect real-world measurements. Better software means a better experience, and this means better relationships - **happier providers and happier staff**.

## What we changed about our platform when we listened to our users {#99c9}

[Accreditron](http://www.accreditron.com/) is a “multi-stakeholder” software product. When designing Accreditron our team has to think about every little interaction or edge-case. _How does someone sign-in? What should be the first thing they see? What happens if we put this button in the bottom-right versus top-left? What if someone tries to click the page 500 times a second?_

## Background {#bde6}

We’re a company of designers, copy-writers, user-researchers, talkers, and software engineers. We prioritise design, full-stop. Moreover, we think that pleasant and purposeful user experience is a key offering to the stakeholders and users of Accreditron. A _stakeholder_ being someone who has interest in the product versus a _user _being a person who will actively engage in using the product. Our stakeholders are spread across different levels of New Zealand Government and the Social Sector. Every person comes from a different background, they think differently from each other, and they all use computers in different ways.

We think Accreditron should be zero cost to the social sector. This means, like many enterprise software companies, the people funding Accreditron are not representative of all the users that will engage with the product. Instead, funding stakeholders might be the management, government leadership, or funding organisations. **Because of this difference in incentives, a disconnect can form between what the funding stakeholder wants and what the users need.**

Usability research is an essential contributor to our success and why we take design and evidence-based decision making seriously. It also allows us to keep the voice of all users at the table and supports us to build our product directly for the people using it. _It’s all about collaboration and communication._

## Usability Research on Accreditron {#42f9}

Usability research is the process of researching and interviewing people who interact with Accreditron. From gathering broad data on their problems or journey — to detailed research like watching a person perform a task to understand their thought process.

For every component on Accreditron, we first research why we should build it and test our assumptions. Then after we design or build something worth testing, we research and measure how our solution performed against our original assumptions. With those results, we can make changes to improve the experience and repeat the process. This is sometimes referred to as the build-measure-learn cycle.

Usability research is one option for gathering data and measuring performance. By holding many usability sessions and interviews, we can pull all of the information together to develop insights across a sample group. Then use these gathered insights to drive the design of Accreditron and provide validation where possible.
