# Process and Procedure

## 1. Briefing Assessors and Working with Ministry

Five regional assessors will be chosen by the ministry to participate in the trial. The assessors will be emailed to arrange a phone call to brief and have a quick interview.  
  
The template for the email is [Assessor - Pre-trial](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1G2aZbrwYBIwCmUHp-1zdURYYTOilfzst0xLmZTxtd7Y) found in the Email Templates folder, this email should also include the info [sheet for Assessors](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_23bP3tsxABls6Jiq7XzXAjaqU0N6wC-z0wUUiO_BBM/edit?usp=sharing).

During the phone conversation, the researcher will answer any questions the Assessor has. The interviewer will follow the [pre-trial assessor script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aM5VJt1TPb4UBqKwGdfbKzvtW5V3BSwkg8IsSTaLmsU/edit?usp=sharing) to prompt questions. Then they will document the answers in the [assessor pre-trial questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1WzUP57MKHUzUBWlnmubZmmtyt20U3pV1o8PF21N-NzM/edit).  

The assessor will then select a provider and contact them regarding the trial. The assessor will have the option to use the [Assessor to Provider - Initial email](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1btNPXUXaoDOT5TlpMiaGnV5v6fnQjFlBwv_xZVzsO_4/edit) provided in the Email Templates folder.

## 2. Pre-trial Interviews

## 5. Processing of Data Collected

Once all interview data has been transcribed into the appropriate questionnaire, the researcher will begin to sort this information into usable findings.  


The researcher will then categorise the collected data for faster analysis. Looking for common trends or themes in the data  
  
For example, trends might include:

1. questions which providers get stuck on,
2. misunderstood concepts, or
3. features that had a strong positive response.

These findings could be about any aspect of the product and could identify:

1. areas which are working well,
2. parts which need improvement, and
3. opportunities for new features.

## 6. Reporting of Findings

Having completed the processing and analysis of data the researcher will compile this into a report and presentation for the Accreditron team and government. The team will use the findings to inform the direction of their design process.
