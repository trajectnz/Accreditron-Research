# Usability Trial 2

## Goal 

Five providers use alpha-release of Accreditron to submit actual pre-assessment information to their assessors.

Accreditron is running a Usability Trial of the pre-assessment workflow for a social service provider undergoing an Accreditation. 

This time the trials will involve both Assessors and Providers. The aim is to have five providers opt-in to use the alpha-release version of Accreditron to submit their pre-assessment to their assessors. 

During this process, we will be interviewing participants on their experience and using their feedback to refine the platform and measure against pre-defined KPIs. This document is to communicate what will make a great usability trial, so we can work together to manage the risks. 

## Background

This is a guide to round two of usability trials for Accreditron. This will let you know what the process is and where to find documents needed throughout the trial.

This trial is for the alpha-release of Accreditron, it will be run with both Providers and Assessors.

If you are new to this trial and somehow found yourself reading this document, take a look at [Trial Outline Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HqHCWVl86rGSQYEN3JJ1E-So1MXllPzbmKHRbHS_WgQ/edit?usp=sharing). This will give a more detailed background and objectives.  
  
This document will outline the planned process for Trial 2. To understand what is being measured - look at the [Assumption and Measurements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HRwmrKezjdj_w0rt9LKtbGu4Oz4u_aUm4_B6fa6jXMk/edit#heading=h.x4z6q96wgo0w) document.

## Participants

**Participant groups**

| Assessor | Provider |
| --- | --- |
| 5 Participants | 5 Organsations |

A sample size of 5 offers an optimal benefit-to-cost ratio. This will provide the the minimum amount of data needed to draw conclusions while still reducing duplication and provider fatigue.

### Each assessor will select a provider that:

1. has an assessment coming up,
2. is a charity entity type,
3. currently maintain a good relationship with, and
4. is a level 2-3 single-site provider with no specialist standards to be reviewed at next assessment.

## Six Stages of Trial 2
