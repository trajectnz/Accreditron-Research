# Usability Trial 2

## Goal 

{% hint style="success" %}
1. To trial the alpha-release version of Accreditron. 
2. Monitor the pre-assessment workflow for providers and assessors.
{% endhint %}

Providers submit their pre-assessment information to their assessors for review with  Accreditron. The trial will monitor the pre-assessment workflow for a social service provider undergoing an Accreditation. 

Trial one monitored providers only. This trial will involve both Assessors and Providers. During this process, we will be interviewing participants on their experience and using their feedback to refine the platform and measure against pre-defined KPIs. This document is to communicate what will make a great usability trial, so we can work together to manage the risks. 

## Participants

The aim is to have five providers opt-in to use the alpha-release version of Accreditron to submit their pre-assessment to their assessors.

### Participant Groups

| Provider | Assessor |
| --- | --- |
| 5 Individuals that represent social service provider organsations and meet the criteria stated below. | 5 Participants from the Social Service Accreditation Team |

{% hint style="info" %}
A sample size of 5 offers an optimal benefit-to-cost ratio. This will provide the the minimum amount of data needed to draw conclusions while still reducing duplication and provider fatigue.
{% endhint %}

### Criteria for Provider Participants

Organisations participating in Trial 2 must:

1. have had an assessment coming up,
2. be a charity entity type,
3. maintain a good relationship with their assessor, 
4. be a level 2-3 single-site provider, and
