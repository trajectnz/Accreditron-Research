# Measuring for Outcomes

## Types of Data Collected

There are two main types of data collected during a trial. Most of the information collected will be qualitative, which is information collected through a structured interview. Qualitative data comes from open ended questions.

**Qualitative Prompt:  
**  
Were there any things in particular that you quite liked about the process?
{% endhint %}

We also collect quantitative data. Quantitative data is used to attach numbers to the data collected. This means that well be able to make comparisons and show trends over time.

**Quantitative Prompt:**

For your last accreditation, how long did it take your organisation to submit the information from when you started the pre-assessment process? 

What percentage of your time was dedicated to the pre-assessment during that time?
{% endhint %}
