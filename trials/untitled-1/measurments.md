# Measuring for Outcomes

## Types of Data Collected

There are two main types of data collected during a trial. Most of the information collected will be qualitative, which is information collected through a structured interview. Qualitative data comes from open ended questions.

**Qualitative Prompt:  
**  
Were there any things in particular that you quite liked about the process?
{% endhint %}

We also collect quantitative data. Quantitative data is used to attach numbers to the data collected. This means that well be able to make comparisons and show trends over time.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Quantitative Prompt:**

For your last accreditation, how long did it take your organisation to submit the information from when you started the pre-assessment process? 

What percentage of your time was dedicated to the pre-assessment during that time?
{% endhint %}

## Quantifying time 

We want to understand how much time is spent on tasks so we can articulate how much time has is saved with different feature additions to Accreditron. 

Our aim Trial 1 was to gather quantifiable information about how much time providers spend on different processes, particularly in their pre-assessment. Providers would not able to put numbers to their time commitment, instead they would answer with qualitative statements 

> We spend two weeks with our staff in the office until 10pm at night preparing for an Accreditation.

As we move into future trials we will focus on different ways to quantify the time commitment
