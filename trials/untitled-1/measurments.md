# Measuring for Outcomes

## Types of Data Collected

There are two main types of data collected during a trial. Most of the information collected will be qualitative, which is information collected through a structured interview. Qualitative data comes from open ended questions.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Qualitative Prompt:  
**  
Were there any things in particular that you quite liked about the process?
{% endhint %}

We also collect quantitative data. Quantitative data is used to attach numbers to the data collected. This means that well be able to make comparisons and show trends over time.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Quantitative Prompt:**

For your last accreditation, how long did it take your organisation to submit the information from when you started the pre-assessment process? 

What percentage of your time was dedicated to the pre-assessment during that time?
{% endhint %}

## Quantifying Time Commitments

We want to understand how much time is spent on tasks so we can articulate how much time has is saved with different feature additions to Accreditron. Time savings is a great way to tangibly show benefit.

Our aim Trial 1 was to gather quantifiable information about how much time providers spend on different processes, particularly their pre-assessment process. Unfortunately, providers participating in the trial we're not able to put numbers to their time commitment, instead they would answer with qualitative statements like:

> We spend two weeks with our staff in the office until 10pm at night preparing for an Accreditation.

or

> We spend a lot of time working on putting all of our information together.

As we move into future trials we will trial asking different questions that can help us quantify how much time is saved when using Accreditron.
