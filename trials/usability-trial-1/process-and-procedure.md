# Process and Procedure

## Interview Structure

Our usability trials consisted of a short pre-trial interview to gather general information with a business admin person from a social service provider. Then we asked the interviewee to perform a task on our pre-release alpha version of Accreditron followed up with a short post-trial interview and questionnaire. Our goal was to gather both qualitative and quantitative data on user experiences for a social service provider using Accreditron.  
  
Each trial was approximately 1.5 hours long and consisted of three components:

1. Pre-trial interview
2. Monitored task
3. Post-trial interview

## Task

All users were given the same task as part of the usability trial. By offering the same prompt to all participants, we ensured that their responses were as unbiased as possible as well as more directly comparable. The task providers were asked to perform was fairly straightforward:
