# Insights

## **Browser Support**

One thing that became clear to us was the importance of supporting a range of browsers. Initially Accreditron only supported Google Chrome, for users on other services such as Firefox, Safari, and Explorer this posed a fundamental issue. Not only this but through our trials we also found that providers sometimes used older versions of these browsers.

Since the first round of trials we’ve introduced much broader browser support making Accreditron much more accessible and user friendly, we’re excited to show off this new

## **Staff File Management**

An area of Accreditron that produced enthusiastic responses from providers was the staffing section. For a lot of providers managing staffing documents is a large pain-point requiring a considerable amount of time and effort to keep in order. **Providers were excited not only by our staffing section but also the potential they saw in it**, ways it could be developed to make their jobs easier with a number offering suggestions around how it could be developed to include vetting status and staffing documents in particular as well as a number of other features.

We’ve taken provider feedback on board and developed our staffing section in ways that we hope will better support their needs. By looking at this again in our trial we can not only make sure that the changes we’ve introduced will further help providers but also see if there is anymore room for changes that make their lives easier and less stressful.

## **Dashboard Comprehension**

In our first phase the Dashboard was still in its early stages and it was unclear if providers fully understood the concept that all of their answers were saved for later. We've continued to develop this feature and we’d like to test this again and see how the changes we’ve made since the first trial have changed the way the Dashboard is viewed by users.

## **Login and Registration**

One of the features we identified as requiring testing was the login and registration. We implemented a passwordless login, a practice becoming more common online, however we wanted to be certain that our participants would be able to make sense of it. This was a big win for Accreditron! All users were able to navigate this process with no hassle.

While we were happy with how this performed we’ve implemented some changes, for example the “email sent” notification is now a modal and the privacy policy has been moved to registration. Because of these changes we’ll be making sure to get feedback on login and registration again to make sure that it’s still clear and easily navigable.
